A simple image search application that implements Pixabay's public API.  Users search for images matching a keyword and the application returns a gallery of those images that link back to Pixabay.  All images in the application are provided by Pixabay. The application implements Angular 4's Http class, Angular Material, and Masonry.js.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
